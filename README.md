## Introduction:
In this project we're required to conduct a User Acceptance Test (UAT) by using RPA. An Excel sheet has been given us which contain various data that we can use to do RPA. If the record passed the test, then we need to update the excel sheet with the test result. TRUE if passed, and FALSE if failed.
